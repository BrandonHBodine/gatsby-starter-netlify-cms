It looks like I let this slip again but here we are on the first day of a brand new year in the early days of a new decade. Conforming with the typical tradition of attempting a fresh start and developing better habits in 2021 I have set aside a long weekend to see what I would like to accomplish in this newest of years. 

I would like to explore some topics that are not solely software based but make use of the software skills I have developed over the last decade. 

The first idea that I have is to try and inject learning into things that I am already addicted to. The project will probably be a multi use chrome extension or a bot that can post to various places I frequent on the web.  To get started I'm going to revisit the [Learning How to Learn Coursera ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)course and do some research in how spaced repetition works for learning vocabulary along with a refresher on how deliberate practice works to see if I can use those concepts to better inject learning into a my day to day internet use.

It seems that the 2020's will bring with it the mass electrification of just about everything as we move away from non-renewable energy sources and into the realm of large scale renewables. The problem for me is I really don't understand much about how electricity works,  how it's generated, or its application in everyday life but I plan on changing that and with it create a site that will house my knowledge on the subject. 

That's enough for now and I hope this will publish.
