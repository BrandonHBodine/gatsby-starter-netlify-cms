I have never been much of a writer or much of a person to take notes on things. There is no place where I have cataloged my experiences, no place where I have collected my thoughts, no place to digest information, and no place where I have a centralized all that I want to. I would like to change that. 

The problem though is since I have never done these things I am bad at it and (as you can already tell) bad at writing. To improve there is only one way and that is to try. I hope that with repetition I will be able to get better at documenting and digesting what I want and gain the skills to capture those ideas in a way that can really represent my thoughts.

So here's to starting and being terrible. 

Cheers.
